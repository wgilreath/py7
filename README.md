# py7 or Ï€-7 Python Code Check Linting Tool

Python py7 or "PI-seven" or Ï€-7 lint tool combines seven Python code checking tools into one interactive tool.

The Py7 lint tool checks if the Python modules are installed in the Python environment, and if not installs the modules. The Py7 lint tool then checks the Python source files specified on the command-line. The seven tools (all open-source) are:

                bandit    - Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python source code.
                mccabe    - Check McCabe complexity in Python source code.
                mypy      - Mypy is a static type checker for Python source code.
                pyflakes  - Pyflakes checks source files for errors in Python source code.
                pylint    - Pylint analyses and checks for errors in Python source code.
                ruff      - Ruff is fast Python check and lint for Python source code.
                vulture   - Vulture detects unused "dead" code in Python source code.

# Telling You Why

My "Why?" is simple, expedience and convenience. I write Python source code daily, and wanted a tool to check and lint, a Python "spell check" but without plug-ins for an IDE, or having to install all the tools, again and again. Hence Py7, which install the tools, and then runs the interactively on Python source code. 

# License

Py7 is licensed under the GNU GPL v3. See the 'LICENSE' file in the repository for more information.

# Contact

Please feel free to contact me about Py7 at will@wfgilreath.xyz, and of course use and improve the Py7 tool! ðŸ˜œ

# Running Py7

Py7 was developed and runs with Python v. 3.10.10; running Py7 at the command-line is simple, give the Python files, or use the --help parameter.

```

py7.py <file1.py> <file2.py> ... <fileN.py> | --help

```

# Example with --help command-line argument

```
~>py7.py --help


Py7 Lint (C) Copyright  Copyright 2023  Release: v 1.1



Usage: py7.py { file.py } | --help
       py7.py myPython.py myApp.py badCode.py

~>

```

# Example using Py7 to check Python Files

An example of Py7 output from a check of several Python source files is:

```
~>py7.py simple_proc.py pyke.py meminfo.py none.py
